## I am not yet finished it. Sorry!

Hello guys, I'm Clark! Today I am not really going to share a power skill in this post, but I am going to talk the process about I learning [styled components](https://styled-components.com/). I hope you can learn something from my share or every beginner can learn what is styled components and how to use it?

# What is styled components?

From we can knew [the official document](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics):

> styled-components is the result of wondering how we could enhance CSS for styling React component systems.

So I think that is useful and helpful, if we apply styled components in our react project(But I have no a real answer, maybe we can find it together or you can commit your opinion below, anything thanks!).

# Create a React project

In this series, I will use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) create a React project. So whether you had installed create-react-app, as long as you installed node and npm(If you didn't, you can reference [this post](https://ms314006.github.io/how-to-install-npm-through-NVM-node-version-manager/)), you can run command below:

```
npx create-react-app practice-styled-components
```

When you finished it, we would have a best environment to practice styled components.

# Install styled-components


# Thanks
